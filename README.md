# Hi, I'm Willian ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently pursuing Electrical Engineering at UFRGS (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul). Iâ€™m an Undergraduate Research (IC) scholar at the Embrapii Simobi Unit, and Iâ€™m also part of the Retrofit project, which aims to create systems for electrifying combustion-engine vehicles.

Here on GitHub youâ€™ll find some of the projects Iâ€™ve builtâ€”and am still buildingâ€”in the following areas:

- **Embedded Systems (Microprocessors & Microcontrollers):** STM32 | PIC  
- **Digital Signal Processing:** Python | Electronics  
- **Projects for Electrified Vehicles**  
- **Data Structures & Data Analysis:** Python | C
